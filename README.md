# Superstore-sales-analysis

This repository contains a series of visualizations created using Tableau to analyze sales data. The visualizations provide insights into various aspects of sales performance, including trends over time, regional performance, product categorization, shipping modes, customer segmentation, and the impact of discounts on profitability.

Visualizations Overview
1. Sales Over Time
Graph Type: Line Chart
Reasoning: Line charts are used to show trends over time, allowing you to track the sum of sales over the order date. This visualization helps identify monthly or quarterly sales trends, peak periods, seasonal patterns, and general sales growth.
2. Sales and Profit by Region
Graph Type: Filled Map
Reasoning: A filled map visualizes how sales and profit are distributed across geographic regions. This helps identify high-performance regions and areas that need improvement.
3. Sales and Profit by Product Category and Sub-Category
Graph Type: Tree Map
Reasoning: Tree maps are ideal for showing hierarchical data. This visualization breaks down sales and profit by product category and sub-category, helping to identify high-revenue, low-profit areas and highlight profitable product segments.
4. Sales and Quantity by Ship Mode
Graph Type: Bar Chart
Reasoning: A bar chart is used to compare sales and order quantities across different shipping modes. This analysis helps understand how different shipping methods affect sales performance and order volume.
5. Customer Segment Analysis
Graph Type: Stacked Bar Chart or Side-by-Side Bar Chart
Reasoning: This visualization shows sales, profit, and possibly quantity across different customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate). It helps analyze which segments contribute most to the business and guides targeted marketing strategies.
6. Discount vs. Profit by Product Sub-Category
Graph Type: Scatter Plot
Reasoning: A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between discount levels and profit across product sub-categories. This allows for the detection of profitability issues linked to discounts and helps in discount strategy optimization.
7. Top 10 Products by Sales
Graph Type: Bar Chart (Sorted in Descending Order)
Reasoning: A bar chart displays the top 10 products by sales, highlighting the highest-grossing items. This visualization supports decision-making regarding inventory management and product marketing.
8. Sales Contribution by Region and Segment
Graph Type: Heat Map
Reasoning: A heat map is used to show the distribution of sales across regions and segments. Varying colors represent different sales levels, helping to identify strong revenue drivers and compare performance across customer demographics and geographic locations.
9. Discount Impact on Sales by Region
Graph Type: Dual-Axis Chart (Bar and Line)
Reasoning: This dual-axis chart combines a bar chart for sales with a line chart for discount percentages across regions. It highlights regions where discounts lead to increased sales versus those where the impact is minimal.
10. Monthly Profit Trend
Graph Type: Area Chart
Reasoning: An area chart shows the cumulative profit trend over time, providing insight into high and low-profit periods. This visualization is useful for forecasting and budget planning.
